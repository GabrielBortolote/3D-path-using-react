# Embed 3D paths using spline

I always wanted to know how to put 3d elements inside an web site. Recently I discovered the tool [spline](https://app.spline.design/), this tool can easily design beautiful 3D paths and them export it to a canvas inside your web site. The tool is very simple to use, I strongly recommend it for those who wants to add this feature to an web site.
